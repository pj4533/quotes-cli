## Features

- **AI-Generated Quotes:** Generate unique and inspiring quotes tailored to your chosen theme.
- **Theme Flexibility:** Optionally specify a theme to guide the nature of the generated quotes.
- **Randomized Inspiration:** Each quote draws inspiration from a randomly selected field (e.g., science, philosophy, nature) to enhance diversity.
- **Random Letter Constraint:** The first word of each quote starts with a randomly selected letter, adding an extra layer of creativity.
- **Interactive Controls:**
  - **Right Arrow (ðŸ‘‰):** Save the displayed quote to a local SQLite database.
  - **Left Arrow (ðŸ‘ˆ):** Discard the current quote and fetch a new one.
- **Verbose Logging:** Use the `-v` or `--verbose` flag to enable verbose logging, which displays the prompt used to generate each quote.
- **Styled Terminal Output:** Enjoy a visually appealing interface with ANSI colors and emojis.
- **Continuous Operation:** The application runs continuously, fetching new quotes until you decide to exit with **Ctrl+C**.
- **Local Storage:** Persist your favorite quotes in a local SQLite database (`quotes.db`) for future reference.
